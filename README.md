Composition based feature vector or CBFV is an important tool to start with for anyone looking to apply machine learning in materials science

I've developed a new GUI application using Tkinter, specifically designed for material scientists and researchers eager to integrate materials science with machine learning!

This intuitive tool allows users to calculate composition-based feature vectors effortlessly. The application can generate a variety of element properties, including:
- Olynyk
- Jarvis
- Magpie
- Mat2Vec
- One Hot
- Random 200

Inspired by and based on CBFV by Kaiin, this GUI streamlines the process, making it accessible and user-friendly for scientists working on cutting-edge materials research and development.

I believe this tool will be incredibly beneficial for those looking to leverage machine learning in their materials science projects. If you're interested in exploring this further or have any questions, feel free to reach out!
